Our growing reliance on the internet to conduct much of our day-to-day business has provided fraudsters with the perfect environment to launch targeted phishing attacks. The phishing attacks taking place today are sophisticated and increasingly more difficult to spot. A study conducted by Intel found that 97% of security experts fail at identifying phishing emails from genuine emails.
